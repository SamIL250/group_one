          <h2>Roman Reigns</h2>
          <p>
            Leati Joseph "Joe" Anoaʻi (Samoan pronunciation: [a.noˈaʔ.i] ah-no-AH ee; born May 25, 1985), better known by the ring name Roman Reigns, is an American professional wrestler and former American football player. He is currently signed to WWE on the SmackDown brand, where he is the current and longest-reigning WWE Universal Champion in his second reign and the current WWE Champion in his fourth reign. Considered one of the best wrestlers in the world,[8][9] his current championship reigns make him WWE's undisputed world champion, referred to within the company as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. He is the leader of The Bloodline stable and is a member of wrestling's renowned Anoaʻi family.[4]

After playing college football for Georgia Tech, Anoaʻi started his professional football career with brief off-season stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) in 2007. He then played a full season for the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football. He then pursued a career in professional wrestling and was signed by WWE in 2010, reporting to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). Under the ring name Roman Reigns, he made his main roster debut in 2012 as a member of The Shield alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins. They teamed together until disbanding in 2014, after which Reigns entered singles competition, though the trio would occasionally reunite until Ambrose left WWE in 2019.
